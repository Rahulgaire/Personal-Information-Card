The Personal Information Card Generator is a web-based application designed to collect user input through a form and dynamically generate visual cards displaying the submitted information. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides an intuitive interface for users to enter their personal details—name, email, phone number, address, and an image—and instantly see them formatted in a card layout.
