# Personal Information Card Generator

The Personal Information Card Generator is a web-based application that collects user input via a form and dynamically generates visual cards displaying the submitted information. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers an intuitive interface to enter name, email, phone, address, and an image, instantly showing them in a card layout.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structures the form and content display.
- **CSS**: Provides basic styling for cards and form elements (optional styling included).
- **JavaScript**: Handles form submission, validation, card generation, and clearing functionality.

## Purpose
This project serves as a practical demonstration of front-end web development concepts, including event handling, DOM manipulation, and file processing. It can be used as a template for contact management systems, user profile displays, or interactive data collection tools.

## Future Enhancements
- Add persistent storage (e.g., localStorage or a database) to save cards.
- Implement image file size and type restrictions.
- Enhance styling with responsive design and animations.
- Add edit and delete functionality for individual cards.
